! ------------ AirfoilInfo v1.01.x Input File ----------------------------------
! DU21 airfoil with an aspect ratio of 17.  Original -180 to 180deg Cl, Cd, and Cm versus AOA data taken from Appendix A of DOWEC document 10046_009.pdf (numerical values obtained from Koert Lindenburg of ECN).
! Cl and Cd values corrected for rotational stall delay and Cd values corrected using the Viterna method for 0 to 90deg AOA by Jason Jonkman using AirfoilPrep_v2p0.xls.
